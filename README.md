## Easy Librarian II


</div>

### Description

This is a code fix update to my original Easy Librarian application. My apologies.

I wrote this for my father to keep track of all the books he owns, though it could be easily adjusted for other media, such as CDs or DVDs. It can also serve as yet another introduction to ADO programming. The code is fairly heavily commented and should be pretty easy to figure out. Comments/Criticisms/Suggestions welcomed.
